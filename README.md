## Introduction - Why I built this?
A few days before I encountered the HTML ```audio``` element and after learning about it from MDN Docs, I thought of building something fun using it.  
and What is better than a musical instrument?   
Hence this idea popped up to try and build a **Piano application** using it!  
> Press buttons (z-m from your keyboard for ```white``` keys and 1-5 for ```black``` keys) OR Click on the piano keys for the music.
